Driving License Eligibility Checker

This Java program determines if a user is eligible for a driving license based on their age. It uses the `Scanner` class to accept age input, evaluates eligibility with an `if-else` statement, and displays the result. 
Simple and efficient, it's a beginner-friendly example of conditional statements in Java.
The code ensures logical branching and demonstrates input validation. Easy to customize, it can be extended with additional conditions or features.
